<strong>Kiwano Portfolio.</strong> The purpose of this project is to provide an interface with 
Binance now, and more exchanges to come, to be able to backtest, livetest and livetrade your 
trading algorithms on crypto-currencies. We thought we could let you focus all your creativity and 
effort on your trading strategies, and let us handle the rest, since this part is simpler 
but necessary.

<strong>Smart DCA.</strong> DCA stands for Dollar Cost Average, and it is the most common way to invest in crypto.
We improved this idea to adjust the amount of money you invest in a crypto-currency, based on the price of the coin.
You tell us the maximum amount of money you want to invest per day, and we tell you how much to invest in BTC
given the market conditions.

<strong>Crypto Arbitrage Finder.</strong> Flash Loans have become a very popular way to make money in the crypto space.
The problem is that you need to be very fast to take advantage of them. We are building a tool that will help you find

    <h2>Mission</h2>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
We are fascinated by crypto and AI and saw an excellent opportunity to use AI to predict crypto prices. 
Not only to trade cryptos effectively, but also to bring predictability to the crypto world. We believe 
that predictable volatility will increase the trust in the technology.
With that in mind, we started Kiwano, to be able to share these predictions with the community in the form 
of buy-and-sell signals.
While this would be our core activity, we plan on exploring more of the opportunities that cryptocurrencies offer. 
In the medium run, we want to build a financial ecosystem around the crypto trees to allow anyone to 
boost their savings.

    <h2>Vision</h2>
  </div>
</div>


<p>
Kiwano is more than just a company or a product; it's an ideal and a philosophy. 
<br>
<br>
Now starting with the bad news, let's be honest, the world is facing significant challenges: global warming, social instabilities, inflation... and among these challenges, the financial system is often taken as being the issue itself by public opinion. As a result, trust in the banking system and its affiliated institutions is in decline.
<br>

<figure class="quote">
  <blockquote>
In this context, we asked ourselves, how can we regain that trust?
  </blockquote>
</figure>

The Bitcoin tree presents itself as an alternative, where transparency could coexist with freedom of choice, resulting in individual and collective empowerment.

<br>
<br>

At Kiwano, we believe that finance can work hand in hand with social causes, and help tackle the challenges of today and tomorrow. By providing stability and predictability to the crypto world, we will grow our projects and allow more entrepreneurs to develop their new exciting ventures.
