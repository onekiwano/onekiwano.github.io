In recent years, there has been a rapid increase of machine learning applications in computational sciences, with some of the most impressive results at the interface of deep learning (DL) and differential equations (DEs). 
DL techniques have been used in a variety of ways to dramatically enhance the effectiveness of DE solvers and computer simulations.
These successes have widespread implications, as DEs are among the most well-understood tools for the mathematical analysis of scientific knowledge, and they are fundamental building blocks for mathematical models in engineering, finance, and the natural sciences.
Conversely, DL algorithms based on DEs--such as neural differential equations and continuous-time diffusion models--have also been successfully employed as deep learning models.
Moreover, theoretical tools from DE analysis have been used to glean insights into the expressivity and training dynamics of mainstream deep learning algorithms. </p>

<p>
This workshop will aim to bring together researchers with backgrounds in computational science and deep learning to encourage intellectual exchanges, cultivate relationships and accelerate research in this area.
The scope of the workshop spans topics at the intersection of DL and DEs, including theory of DL and DEs, neural differential equations, solving DEs with neural networks, and more. </p>

  <p> <span style="font-weight:500;">Submission:</span>
  <br/>
    Accepted submissions will be presented during joint poster sessions and will be made publicly available as non-archival reports, allowing future submissions to archival conferences or journals. 
    Exceptional submissions will be either selected for four 15-minute contributed talks
    or eight 5-minute spotlight oral presentations. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Submissions should be up to 4 pages excluding references, acknowledgements, and supplementary material, and should be
      <span style="color:#3a92d6;font-weight:400;"><a href="https://github.com/dlde-2022/dlde-2022.github.io/tree/master/static/sty/dlde_neurips_2022.sty">DLDE-NeurIPS format</a></span> and anonymous. Long appendices are permitted but strongly discouraged, and reviewers are not required to read them. The review process is double-blind.
  </p>
  <p>
  We also welcome submissions of recently published work that is strongly within the scope of the workshop (with proper formatting). We encourage the authors of such submissions to focus on accessibility to the wider NeurIPS community while distilling their work into an extended abstract. Submission of this type will be eligible for poster sessions after a lighter review process.
  </p>
  <p>
  Authors may be asked to review other workshop submissions. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Please submit your extended abstract to <span style="color:#3a92d6;font-weight:400;"><a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2022/Workshop/DLDE">this address.</a></span>
